# Weekly report

## Team report
  ### Goals from last week:
  - Mikheil: Make adjustments to pages. Also, seek out more tasks.

  - Liam: Work on the client by learning WebSockets and integrating asyncio.

  - Hoang: Fix up the server code to handle cookies, login, signup, etc.

  - Zach: Complete Clap integration so the AI or users can interact at the command line.

  - Xiang: Start finetuning the language model with open source and custom data.
  
  ### Progress:
  - Mikheil: Made some database and admin page adjustments but needs more time to improve functionality.

  - Liam: Still unsure about implementing the client functionality and where it goes syntactically, despite having an idea now.

  - Hoang: Added command line arguments and config file support for the WebSocket server.

  - Zach: Converted the program to run on the command line with arguments and began work on scraping text from selected sites.

  - Xiang: Tried to set up the dataset to finetune the LLMs but ran into errors. Need to download the dataset locally to train and finetune it.

  ### Plan for next week:
  - Mikheil: Work with Liam on implementing the client side, as well as updating documentation and instructions for the Django database in preparation for peer reviews.

  - Liam: Aim to finally implement the client functionality, which has been a weekly goal.

  - Hoang: Finish adding config file support and do overall cleanup before the alpha release.

  - Zach: Complete the text parser that scrapes and writes site content to a file.

  - Xiang: Debug the script, download the dataset locally, and train and finetune the models before the alpha release

## Contributions of individual team members

  ### Goals from last week:
  - Mikheil: Make some adjustments to the database and  admin page. After that, I will discuss with my team so I am assigned to a new task.
  - Liam: This week's goal is to work on the client, this is done by learning part of the websockets documentation and then integrating asyncio on the websockets documentation.
  - Hoang: Fix up server code to take into account cookies, login, signup, etc...
  - Zach: Complete Clap integration to be test-ready for AI to access (Or users to interact with on a command line level).
  - Xiang: Start to finetune the LLM with useful open-source data and our own data.
  
  ### Progress:
  - Mikheil: Made adjustments to the database and admin page, I still need more time to improve functionality, 
  - Liam: Oh dear, last week's goal was to implement client? I have an idea now but still am generally unsure where it goes. Like, syntactically.
  - Hoang: add command line arguments for Websocket server, also add in config file support.
  - Zach: Converted the program to run on the command line with arguments, and also began work on scraping text from selected sites.
  - Xiang: Try to set up the dataset to finetune with llama 2 LLM using peft, but the script is kind of broken and causes a whole bunch of errors. Need to physically download the dataset on the local machine in order to              train it and finetune it.
    
  ### Plan for next week:
  - Mikheil: Work with Liam to implement client side, and prepare the project for peer reviews i.e. update Django and DB documentation and instructions.
  - Liam: So it remains the weekly goal. This time, I intend to implement it. For real.
  - Hoang: Finish adding in config file support and clean up before the alpha is ready.
  - Zach: Finish work on text parser for the site (currently only writes the raw HTML of the site to a file)
  - Xiang: Fix the script and download the dataset physically on the local machine to train and finetune before the alpha release

  ### Questions for Nate:
  - Update on the port forwarding issue?
