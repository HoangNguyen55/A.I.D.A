# Weekly report

## Team report
  ### Goals from last week:
  - Mikheil: I will be working on the client side, to send and receive requests and data using WebSockets. I will also add test cases for the admin page.
            
  - Liam: Work on integrating WebSockets with Django using a guide from the WebSockets webpage.
            
  - Hoang: Run AI on a school machine and provide it with input.
            
  - Zach: Complete Clap framework integration this week, with plans to improve the href value scraper and enable recursive searching for more text on the best website.
            
  - Xiang: Address the "generate new query" issue and fine-tune something.
  
  ### Progress:
  - Mikheil: 

  - Liam: Integrated Django with WebSockets, realizing it was better suited for the backend. Add migrations in CI/CD when code is merged (as an idea in the future).

  - Hoang: Made the client and server into runnable Python modules, fixed up AI code, and confirmed it runs successfully.

  - Zach: Found integrating Clap caused confusion and instead created a configuration for command line user input, though the logic is still in progress.

  - Xiang: Worked with Nate to fix school PCs to run on the right GPU, which sped up code execution and output generation.

  ### Plan for next week:
  - Mikheil: 

  - Liam: Work on the client by learning WebSockets and integrating asyncio.

  - Hoang: Fix up the server code to handle cookies, login, signup, etc.

  - Zach: Complete Clap integration so the AI or users can interact at the command line.

  - Xiang: Start finetuning the language model with open source and custom data.

## Contributions of individual team members

  ### Goals from last week:
  - Mikheil:
  - Liam: Attempt to integrate WebSockets with Django. It's one of the how-to guides on the WebSockets webpage.
  - Hoang: Run the AI on the school machine, and feed it input.
  - Zach: Clap framework integration should be complete by the end of this week, as testing for the AI is nearly ready. A stretch goal is to fix the href value scraper and allow for a recursive search into the best            website "match" and scrape more text from the target.
  - Xiang: Fix the generate new query issue. And finetune.
  
  ### Progress:
  - Mikheil: 
  - Liam: Last week's goal was to integrate Django with WebSockets. I now know that's a job for the backend, and I'm the frontend. Also, it's currently not needed. At least I had the idea to make migrations and migrate in     the CI/CD, however, it is only when it is merged.
  - Hoang: Make client and server an actual runnable Python module, fix up AI codes, and test to see if it runs (it does)
  - Zach: Clap Framework integration was proven to be confusing to implement with the current program. Configuration for command line user input was created but the actual logic function has not yet been completed.
  - Xiang: Hoang and I talked with Nate about fixing the school PC not running on the Correct GPU generating, the output is taking forever and after the problem was fixed, we fixed the code was able to run successfully on     the school PC feeding the input and generating the output very quickly.

  ### Plan for next week:
  - Mikheil:
  - Liam: This week's goal is to work on the client, this is done by learning part of the websockets documentation and then integrating asyncio on the websockets documentation.
  - Hoang: fix up server code to take into account cookies, login, signup, etc...
  - Zach: Complete Clap integration to be test-ready for AI to access (Or users to interact with on a command line level).
  - Xiang: Start to finetune the LLM with useful open-source data and our own data.

  ### Questions for Nate:
  - Clarification on Alpha version requirements
  - Update on the port forwarding issue?
