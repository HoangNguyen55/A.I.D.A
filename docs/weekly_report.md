## Contributions of individual team members

  ### Goals from last week:
  - Mikheil: Work with Liam to implement client side, and prepare the project for peer reviews i.e. update Django and DB documentation and instructions.
  - Liam: So it remains the weekly goal. This time, I intend to implement it. For real.
  - Hoang: Finish adding in config file support and clean up before the alpha is ready.
  - Zach: Finish work on text parser for the site (currently only writes the raw HTML of the site to a file)
  - Xiang: Fix the script and download the dataset physically on the local machine to train and finetune before the alpha release
  
  ### Progress:
  - Mikheil: Made adjustments to the database and admin page and add functionality
  - Liam: Helping Mikheil made adjustments to the database and admin page.
  - Hoang: Fixing up some stuff in the alpha (still need more fixing) (at least the AI is running(by itself) for real this time (for real))
  - Zach: Rewrote website specific text parser into main program after branch merge for alpha release deleted some progress.
  - Xiang: Fixed the the scripts canâ€™t access to modify linux cache file issue, and also fixed the running out of memory issue when      fine-tuning. Fine-tuning model is finished still need to test it.
    
  ### Plan for next week:
   - Mikheil: Need to tests things again to make sure everything is ready for peer reviews

  - Liam: I suppose I am content with improving the database by giving it extra functions. I've already pushed "delete" to another branch. This and perhaps some client improvements, if I can manage, will be my final tasks.

  - Hoang: Actually fixing all of error for the alpha, (client/server hangs on long processes (might need to switch to multithreading instead of async)) (still need to test if the AI actually working with the app)

  - Zach:  Planning on getting the text parser working, along with assigning specific functionality to each command line flag

  - Xiang: Test the fine-tuned model and also test the time complexity when generating the query after tuned and try to reduce it

  ### Questions for Nate:
  - currently no question
