  - Hoang: write database test cases
            
  - Zach: finish the AAER search
            
  - Xiang: finetune LLM
  
  ### Progress:
  - Mikheil: 

  - Liam: Read the documentation but hasn't used it.

  - Hoang: Restructured code and added database test cases.

  - Zach: Started integrating Rust clap framework for terminal commands and improved HTML link scraping.

  - Xiang: Model testing issue in .ipynb file, works fine in Google Colab.
        
  ### Plan for next week:
  - Mikheil:
            
  - Liam: Work on integrating WebSockets with Django using a guide from the WebSockets webpage.
            
  - Hoang: Run AI on a school machine and provide it with input.
            
  - Zach: Complete Clap framework integration this week, with plans to improve the href value scraper and enable recursive searching for more text on the best website.
            
  - Xiang: Address the "generate new query" issue and fine-tuning something.

## Contributions of individual team members

  ### Goals from last week:
  - Mikheil: Work on the client
  - Liam: work on the client
  - Hoang: write database test cases
  - Zach: finish the AAER search
  - Xiang: finetune LLM
  
  ### Progress:
  - Mikheil: 
  - Liam: looking at the getting started documentation and then doing nothing with it, not even experimenting in my own time with the given code as of now.
  - Hoang: Move the codes around so that the structure makes more sense, create some test cases for the database
  - Zach: Began work on integrating rust clap framework to allow the program to be run via terminal commands (--search "sdfasdfsdf" -e -url). Also continued searching for the best solution to scraping HTML links and href            values using the current selector.
  - Xiang: After doing more testing of the model I found that when generating a new query it got stuck forever, not generating a new query. Everything works fine in Google Collab but is in .ipynb file.

  ### Plan for next week:
  - Mikheil:
  - Liam: Attempt to integrate websockets with Django. It's one of the how-to guides on the Websockets webpage.
  - Hoang: Run the AI on the school machine, and feed it input.
  - Zach: Clap framework integration should be complete by the end of this week, as testing for the AI is nearly ready. A stretch goal is to fix the href value scraper and allow for a recursive search into the bestwebsite           "match" and scrape more text from the target.
  - Xiang: Fix the generate new query issue. And finetune.

  ### Questions for Nate:
  - Clarification on Slurm
  - Update on accessing school machines from home?
